#Prerequisite Knowledge
#----------------------
'''
To make sense of this program you need to have/acquire the following prerequisite knowledge-- all
doable and constituting a wonderful journey, for you dear reader. (Please ignore the parts you
have a background in.)

1. Be able to write some small Python programs.

You will not be able to read Python if you have never written the code. If no programming
experience, consider acquiring this skill. Allocate 200 hours. A myriad of online courses exist.

2. Understand at a basic level the landscape of data science and machine learning.

Again, you cannot just read this material -- you need to do some projects. You may have
this skill (no one is expert in every aspect of data science/ machine learning -- it is too
large), but again, if you don't, consider acquiring it. If you have a math background allocate
200 hours, if no math background (feel comfortable with matrices and partial derivatives) then
then allocate an extra 200 hours, ie, 400 hours in total. There are a myriad of available courses.

3. Have an introductory background in computer theory and cognitive science.

This is essential to understand why we are doing the things we are doing. The large question
is why even write this program? Why not just use one of those deep learning neural networks
that already exist and seem to do magical "AI" things?
To save time, consider working through the introductory book Algorithmics by David Harel, about
40 hours,and for cognitive science consider allocating 20 hours to reading reference papers listed
below. ("Reading papers" == making notes in a notebook so you learn the material.)

4. When you read the code please use one the many programming editors (use Windows? try Notepad++)
which will show different parts of the code in different colors.

#Programming Style
#-----------------
'''
The programming style is a very simple one in theory: "write for you, the reader, not the
computer."

For future (hopefully :) contributors to this project:

-We thus use an English-like language such as Python as much as possible.
-To avoid the need for C code in critical sections of the program, we attempt to ensure the code
will run under PyPy, and as well, optimize such critical sections.
-Instead of having a long style section/manual for this project, please download and install
Pylint. We use the arbitrary wisdom of Pylint to decide what style we should or shouldn't use,
plus the general (if not philosophical) rules below.
-We avoid showing the cleverness of the coder, eg, combining 7 actions in a single Python line
when multiple lines would make this more readable and understandable. We write for the person
who must read and understand the code; we don't write for ourselves nor for the computer. (With
the small exception of optimized code routines where necessary for essential functioning.)
-All the 'spaghetti code' of MBLS version 2 has been replaced (by virtue of necessity -- we are
simulating a search-and-rescue robot rather than the detection of numerical digits).
-We increase the reliability of the code by unit/functional testing. We favor easy to use/read
unit tests (eg, Pytest-like) versus more complex ones (eg, PyUnit/unittest-like).
-We catch the heisenbugs -- we create a 'verbose' mode in unit tests and as well do formal logging
of checkpoint events outside of unit tests in normal program running.
-We respect that humans have operating characteristics, to wit, the Ebbinghaus/Miller capacity of
the human mind to process information -- possibly 7 Â± 2 items.
-We avoid short variable names but try to use names which allow the reader to follow what the
variable represents. (Hard to remember what a variable means after seeing a hundred other ones.)
-We avoid cargo cult programming -- no copying of code and no code that is not justified with
regards to this AGI project
-In keeping with the avoidance of cargo cult phenomena, we only use classes if really necessary
to ensure a data structure is not abused by other parts of the program. Otherwise we don't.
(Yikes!! But.... this is brain friendly code, not arbitrary OO friendly code). Again, with
apologies to the OO world, the class name is another piece of data for your brain to remember.
-Unfortunately, there is too much code to keep as a single 'Main' module and we do break up
the code into imported modules, so there are module names but we make as easy to remember.
-We keep functions as small as possible and will -- if appropriate -- break them up if they cover
too much new material (except verbose mode added for in/unit testing purposes).
-TODO comments are actually encouraged. (Pylint and some editors will track/flag TODO's.)
-Type annotations are 'encouraged' (but not mandatory as effectiveness uncertain).
At present mypy used (to install: pip install mypy-lang) (to run:eg, mypy mbls300.py)
-Ok to disable Pylint warnings but provide a justification and enable when appropriate

#Biological Inspiration of Cognitive Architecture and Cognitive Functioning
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''
With pride the MBLS implementation of the Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture is inspired by
biological neurological cognitive architectures and biological cognitive functioning. It is NOT
the goal of the MBLS to implement a simulation of a biological nervous system at a
spiking-neuron level. Actually it is NOT the intention of the MBLS to simulate a biological
nervous system at a higher level either. Rather, we are inspired by biology, and use the
valuable design nature has provided, to create the best possible artificial cognitive system.
In doing so, however, there may be useful reflections that allow us to better understand
the mammalian nervous system, albeit at the mesoscopic level and above. Again, we are
inspired by biology, and our simulations may help increase the understanding the latter,
but we design and program to create the best possible artificial cognitive functioning ==
best possible AGI (artificial general intelligence) == best possible HLAI (human level
artificial intelligence).
'''
#
#
#Reproducibility
#---------------
'''
The basis of the scientific method (of which just about all the scientific, medical, technological
wonders around you emerged from) is reproducibility -- the studies/experiments/work of others
must be able to be replicated by you (assuming appropriate knowledge and equipment, of course).
However, there is somewhat of a "reproducibility crisis" in science, particularly severe in the
cognitive sciences, eg, Science,2015 Aug 28;349(6251), "Estimating the reproducibility of
psychological science" -- a huge percentage of published work cannot be replicated. This issue
extends to neural networks and the whole field of artificial intelligence, eg, Science,2018 Feb 16
;359(6377):725-726, "Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis."

Thus, in the MBLS project we make every effort to ensure that you, dear reader, can reproduce the
workings of the MBLS and reproduce our results. Without getting into the fringe areas of the
'Entscheidungsproblem' (eg, is the MBLS super-Turing because a person with paper and pen could not
reproduce certain operations of the MBLS(actually, according to CT thesis this should not occur)),
while results may vary from run to run, from overall simulation to simulation, we endeavor to show
the consistencies in patterns and findings. Most important, is that you can reproduce the MBLS and
you can reproduce these consistencies.
'''
#
#
#Safety
#------
'''
Safety seems irrelevant at this early point of design and implementation of the MBLS, but such
is the argument in the AI and AGI communities that for systems which grow to become
superintelligence systems it will be argued at their start that it is too early to spend time
on safety issues (ie, safety in preventing the system from becoming some unproven
superintelligent system that would exponentially improve itself and then be a danger to
humankind). However, we note one important difference of the MBLS versus other AGI potential
systems -- the MBLS not only has an intuitive physics and intuitive psychology but also has
among its intuitive systems an intuitive human culture system. Just as it knows at a very
basic level that objects are permanent, for example, it knows at a very basic level its
purpose is to benefit the humans it interacts with. (There are many arguments in the AGI
community why this or that safeguard is not adequate, and such arguments could also be applied
to the intuitive human culture of the MBLS, but we argue in return this is a very strong
safeguard for one, and and for two, with apologies for the irony, at this point in the development
of the MBLS we don't have the resources to spend more effort on this issue.)

With regard to the potential for superintelligence, an honest answer would be "yes" -- if the
number of working memories in the MBLS is increased and the quasi-instruction set that
manipulates vectors in and to and from the working memories is made more sophisticated,
and the algorithmic section is ramped up, then yes, a superintelligence of sorts should
emerge. But, this is not the goal of the MBLS and no work is planned in this area.

#1. INTRODUCTION: Why Create this Program?
#
#Introduction
#------------
'''At the time of this writing, despite the human-like performance of artificial neural networks
(ANNs) in sensory processing and reinforcement learning (Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville,
2016; Mnih, Kavukcuoglu, Silver, et al., 2015), such neural networks, trained with a very
small quantity of examples, cannot causally make sense of their environment or information
at the level a four-year old child can (Gopnik, Glymour, Sobel et al., 2004; Waismeyer,
Meltzoff, and Gopnik, 2015).  Recent successful work by Graves, Wayne, Reynolds and colleagues
(2016) helps to narrow the neural-symbolic gap. Their model involves an ANN which can read
and write to an external memory, i.e., a hybrid system. However, like the human brain, the
meaningful-based learning system (MBLS), introduced below, can perform the sensory
processing associated with ANNs and the efficient symbolic logic associated with human
cognition, without the use of an external memory, i.e., it is not a physically hybrid system.

Abstract from:
	2018 Annual International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures
	Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture by Howard Schneider:

"An overview is given of the cognitive architecture of the biologically inspired
meaningful-based learning system (MBLS). The basic element of the MBLS is a reconfigurable
Hopfield-like network (HLN) which can rapidly connect to other HLNs depending on the level
of abstraction which yields a practical maximal âmeaningfulness,â defined as the reciprocal
of the Shannon entropy of the HLNs. Without any external memory the MBLS synergistically
processes external data (and internal data â âthoughtsâ) with sensory processing abilities
found in neural networks and some of the symbolic logical abilities found in human cognition.
In practical applications the MBLS offers near-simultaneous pattern recognition and
comprehension. In modeling the development of psychotic disorders in humans, the MBLS
predicts that in many patients the etiology stems from the fragility of the working memory
and the integration of additional reasoning mechanisms during adolescence." '''

Scroll down to "MAIN PROGRAM CODE" section to see what program does at a

#TL;DR
#-----
'''This code is a simulation of a learning system that tries to combine neural network-like
learning (eg, the way a deep learning network recognizes a photograph) with symbolic-like
learning (eg, if X=2 and Y=3 then X + Y should be 5). Scroll down to 'Main Program' section
to see what the code is doing.

We program to tell a clear story and at the same time create an AGI.

#2. SLEEP/WAKE AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS

#The sleep/wake and autonomic functions are inspired by the analogous biological functions,
#but their purpose is not to mimic nature but provide a useful level of very high overall
#control of the MBLS with regard to the sleep/wake functions, and to provide
#"stimulus->action"=="reflex" == "reptilian-like neurological functioning" ie, no cortical-like
#functioning but more of stimulus-action functioning although the strong caveat is made
#here that reptiles and birds and have cortical-like portions of their pallium and the
#stimulus->action effect is actually much more involved and processed than say stimulus->action
#in a worm. Thus, really the autonomic functions should be thought of as providing
#invertebrate-like stimulus->action processing, or if the case of mammals is considered,
#basic reflexes and basic autonomic processing.
#
#
#This section will be divided in future as number of functions grow into separate sleep/wake
#section, separate reflex autonomic function section (useful for very fast decisions)
#and more processed autonomic function section.
