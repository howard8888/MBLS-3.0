#Prerequisite Knowledge
#----------------------
'''
To make sense of this program you need to have/acquire the following prerequisite knowledge-- all
doable and constituting a wonderful journey, for you dear reader. (Please ignore the parts you
have a background in.)

1. Be able to write some small Python programs.

You will not be able to read Python if you have never written the code. If no programming
experience, consider acquiring this skill. Allocate 200 hours. A myriad of online courses exist.

2. Understand at a basic level the landscape of data science and machine learning.

You may have this skill, but again, if you don't, consider acquiring it. If you have a math
background then allocate 100- 200 hours, if no math background then allocate an extra 200 hours,
ie, 400 hours in total. There are a myriad of available online courses.

3. Have an introductory background in computer theory and cognitive science.

Why we are doing the things we are doing? Why even write this program? Why not just use one of
those 'magical' deep learning neural networks? To acquire some background in computer theory,
consider working through the introductory book Algorithmics by David Harel (old book but the best
out there still), about 40 hours, and for cognitive science consider allocating 20 hours to
critically reading reference papers listed below.

4. When you read the code please use one of the many programming editors (Windows? try Notepad++)
which will show different parts of the code in different colors.

#
#Programming Style
#-----------------
'''
The programming style is a very simple one in theory: "write for you, the reader, not the
computer."

For distant future (hopefully :) contributors to this project:

-We thus use an English-like language such as Python as much as possible.
-We use the arbitrary wisdom of Pylint to decide what style we should or shouldn't use,
plus the general (if not philosophical) rules below. (Please download and install Pylint.)
-We avoid showing the cleverness of the coder, eg, combining 7 actions in a single Python line
when multiple lines would make this more readable and understandable. We write for the person
who must read and understand the code; we don't write for ourselves nor for the computer. (With
the small exception of optimized code routines where necessary for essential functioning.)
-All the 'spaghetti code' of MBLS version 2 has been replaced (by virtue of necessity -- we are
simulating a search-and-rescue robot rather than the detection of numerical digits).
-We increase the reliability of the code by unit/functional testing. We favor easy to use/read
unit tests (eg, Pytest-like) versus more complex ones (eg, PyUnit/unittest-like).
-We catch the heisenbugs -- we create a 'verbose' mode in unit tests and as well do formal logging
of checkpoint events outside of unit tests in normal program running.
-We respect that humans have operating characteristics, to wit, the Ebbinghaus/Miller capacity of
the human mind to process information -- possibly 7 Â± 2 items.
-We avoid short variable names but try to use names which allow the reader to follow what the
variable represents. (Hard to remember what a variable means after seeing a hundred other ones.)
-We avoid cargo cult programming -- no blind copying of code and no code that is not justified
with regards to this AGI project
-In keeping with the avoidance of cargo cult phenomena, we only use classes if really necessary
to ensure a data structure is not abused by other parts of the program. Otherwise we don't.
(Yikes!! But.... this is brain friendly code, not arbitrary OO friendly code). Again, with
apologies to the OO world, the class name is another piece of data for your brain to remember.
-We keep functions as small as possible and will -- if appropriate -- break them up if they cover
too much new material (except verbose mode added for in/unit testing purposes).
-TODO comments are actually encouraged. (Pylint and some editors will track/flag TODO's.)
-Type annotations are 'encouraged' (but not mandatory as effectiveness uncertain).
At present mypy used (to install: pip install mypy-lang) (to run:eg, mypy mbls300.py)
-Ok to disable Pylint warnings but provide a justification and enable when appropriate

#HOP (Human Oriented Programming)
#--------------------------------
#
pragma(ebbinghaus=5)
'''
Future project -- see GitHub page "Classless but Ebbinghaus-polite Python Coding"
https://github.com/howard8888/pycon-ca-2018

Goal is to automatically reconfigure code to Ebbinghaus/Miller number the reader feels
comfortable with (ie, code readability and organization adapts to human brain functioning).

HOP goal is to account for the human's abilities and provide the paradigm and human memory
loading that works best for the human reader/programmer rather than a rigid OOP approach.

(HOP (Human Oriented Programming) should not be confused with Role Oriented Programming -- we
don't look for vague ways humans do things (ie, as "roles") but are directly concerned with
neurophysiological bandwidth and working-memory processing abilities of human reader/programmer.)

While reading the code below you may encounter comments such as, for example:
    #HOP NOTE: From 'Flags used for Development Purposes' at start of code
'HOP NOTE' means it was generated via the Human Oriented Programming system and is intended to
help a human with finite working memories, ie, you, dear reader.
'''
#
#
#Running the Code on Multiple Cores
#----------------------------------
'''
-At this time the increased execution speed required for critical sections of the code has not
been resolved. Running the code in PyPy, at the time of this writing is possible (but may change
depending on future code/dependencies), and provides half an order of magnitude of speed up.
However, both the usual Python (ie, CPython) and the PyPy version, effectively only offer
single core performance due to usage of Python's GIL (global interpreter lock).

Due to the 'toy size' of the current implementations of the MBLS, a pure Python implementation
at this time is satisfactory. In the future we can consider using the Standard Library's
multiprocessing module as well as running critical code in multi-core compatible binaries
appropriately wrapped for the Python code. Perhaps eventually the Python code's purpose will be
to essentially provide orchestration of various specialized software/hardware units.
'''
#
#
#Embedded Software/Hardware Management
#-------------------------------------
'''
Goal of MBLS-3.0 Implementation is to use the Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture to
control a Search-and-Rescue Robot, with the simulation of finding a lost hiker in a forest
filled with a host of sensory noise and other irrelevant sensory signals.

Details concerning this implementation, including embedded software, particularly an
implementation on multiple MicroPython boards, is discussed in detail in the section farther
below devoted to embedded software/hardware management.
Note: MicroPython is an open source software under the MIT license which at this time has over
two hundred contributors.
Note: Although in theory MicroPython can run on a variety of micro-controller boards, in practice
a 'PyBoard' or equivalent (eg, WiPy IoT platform) should be used since the PyBoard has been
designed to run MicroPython code. PyBoards are not as readily available as other micro-controller
boards, eg, Arduino's, but can be commercially purchased from a few sources.
Note: MicroPython was not able to be run on an unmodified Arduino in MBLS proof of concept trials.
'''
#
#
#Biological Inspiration of Cognitive Architecture and Cognitive Functioning
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''
With pride the MBLS implementation of the Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture is inspired by
biological neurological cognitive architectures and biological cognitive functioning. It is NOT
the goal of the MBLS to implement a simulation of a biological nervous system at a
spiking-neuron level. Actually it is NOT the intention of the MBLS to simulate a biological
nervous system at a higher level either. Rather, we are inspired by biology, and use the
valuable design nature has provided, to create the best possible artificial cognitive system.
In doing so, however, there may be useful reflections that allow us to better understand
the mammalian nervous system, albeit at the mesoscopic level and above. Again, we are
inspired by biology, and our simulations may help increase the understanding the latter,
but we design and program to create the best possible artificial cognitive functioning ==
best possible AGI (artificial general intelligence) == best possible HLAI (human level
artificial intelligence).
'''
#
#
#Reproducibility
#---------------
'''
The basis of the scientific method (of which just about all the scientific, medical, technological
wonders around you emerged from) is reproducibility -- the studies/experiments/work of others
must be able to be replicated by you (assuming appropriate knowledge and equipment, of course).
However, there is somewhat of a "reproducibility crisis" in science, particularly severe in the
cognitive sciences, eg, Science,2015 Aug 28;349(6251), "Estimating the reproducibility of
psychological science" -- a huge percentage of published work cannot be replicated. This issue
extends to neural networks and the whole field of artificial intelligence, eg, Science,2018 Feb 16
;359(6377):725-726, "Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis."
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6377/725

Thus, in the MBLS project we make every effort to ensure that you, dear reader, can reproduce the
workings of the MBLS and reproduce our results. Without getting into the fringe areas of the
'Entscheidungsproblem' (eg, is the MBLS super-Turing because a person with paper and pen could not
reproduce certain operations of the MBLS(actually, according to CT thesis this should not occur)),
while results may vary from run to run, from overall simulation to simulation, we endeavor to show
the consistencies in patterns and findings. Most important, is that you can reproduce the MBLS and
you can reproduce these consistencies.
'''
#
#
#Safety
#------
'''
Safety seems irrelevant at this early point of design and implementation of the MBLS, but such
is the argument in the AI and AGI communities that for systems which grow to become
superintelligence systems it will be argued at their start that it is too early to spend time
on safety issues (ie, safety in preventing the system from becoming some unproven
superintelligent system that would exponentially improve itself and then be a danger to
humankind). However, we note one important difference of the MBLS versus other AGI potential
systems -- the MBLS not only has an intuitive physics and intuitive psychology but also has
among its intuitive systems an intuitive human culture system. Just as it knows at a very
basic level that physical objects are permanent, for example, it knows at a very basic level its
purpose is to benefit the humans it interacts with. (There are many arguments in the AGI
community why this or that safeguard is not adequate, and such arguments could also be applied
to the intuitive human culture of the MBLS, but we argue in return this is a very strong
safeguard for one, and and for two, with apologies for the irony, at this point in the development
of the MBLS we don't have the resources to spend more effort on this issue.)

With regard to the potential for the MBLS to yield superintelligence, an honest answer would be
"yes" -- if the number of working memories in the MBLS is increased and the quasi-instruction set
that manipulates vectors in and to and from the working memories is made more sophisticated,
and the algorithmic section is ramped up, then yes, a superintelligence of sorts should
emerge. But, this is not the goal of the MBLS and no work is planned in this area.

#into the function, is functional -- the unit test is part of the function, not a separate
#test function and not outside of the main program, but rather, the unit test is part of the
#function and is activated via a simple mechanism such as the setting of a flag on program startup.
#Anecdotally from the HOP perspective, this testing does not have to be exhaustive (ie, some level
#of 'smoke testing' or 'build verification testing' has is fine to accomplish the HOP goal).

#1. Acquire the knowledge listed in the section higher above.
#2. You may have used a learning environment to learn Python. Please uninstall it.
#   Install Python with same version as listed above. ( https://www.python.org )
#3. Install a proper code editor. (eg, Windows?  https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ )
#4. Learn how use/setup GitHub (or equivalent git in future). ( https://github.com/ )
#5. Install Pylint. ((command line)> pip install pylint )
#6. Install mypy. ((command line)>pip install mypy-lang )
#7. Install third-party dependencies as explained in the section above. There is a requirements.txt
#   file (explained above) in the GitHub (or equiv) page -- use it.
#8. You need to make sure the MBLS code modules (also on same GitHub (or equiv) page) are in
#   the path of your program (tip- copy them to the directory you are using).
#9. Install latest Pytest ((command line)>pip install pytest )
#10.At the time of writing above is correct, but it will change, eg, in future perhaps we use a
#   a different unit testing utility than Pytest, etc. Please read the comments above and below.

#
#Introduction
#------------
'''At the time of this writing, despite the human-like performance of artificial neural networks
(ANNs) in sensory processing and reinforcement learning (Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville,
2016; Mnih, Kavukcuoglu, Silver, et al., 2015), such neural networks, trained with a very
small quantity of examples, cannot causally make sense of their environment or information
at the level a four-year old child can (Gopnik, Glymour, Sobel et al., 2004; Waismeyer,
Meltzoff, and Gopnik, 2015).  Recent successful work by Graves, Wayne, Reynolds and colleagues
(2016) helps to narrow the neural-symbolic gap. Their model involves an ANN which can read
and write to an external memory, i.e., a hybrid system. However, like the human brain, the
meaningful-based learning system (MBLS), introduced below, can perform the sensory
processing associated with ANNs and the efficient symbolic logic associated with human
cognition, without the use of an external memory, i.e., it is not a physically hybrid system.

Abstract from:
	2018 Annual International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures
	Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture by Howard Schneider:

"An overview is given of the cognitive architecture of the biologically inspired
meaningful-based learning system (MBLS). The basic element of the MBLS is a reconfigurable
Hopfield-like network (HLN) which can rapidly connect to other HLNs depending on the level
of abstraction which yields a practical maximal âmeaningfulness,â defined as the reciprocal
of the Shannon entropy of the HLNs. Without any external memory the MBLS synergistically
processes external data (and internal data â âthoughtsâ) with sensory processing abilities
found in neural networks and some of the symbolic logical abilities found in human cognition.
In practical applications the MBLS offers near-simultaneous pattern recognition and
comprehension. In modeling the development of psychotic disorders in humans, the MBLS
predicts that in many patients the etiology stems from the fragility of the working memory
and the integration of additional reasoning mechanisms during adolescence." '''

#TL;DR
#-----
'''This code is a simulation of a learning system that tries to combine neural network-like
learning (eg, the way a deep learning network recognizes a photograph) with symbolic-like
learning (eg, if X=2 and Y=3 then X + Y should be 5). Scroll down to 'Main Program' section
to see what the code is doing.

We program to tell a clear story and at the same time create an AGI.

#2. SLEEP/WAKE AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS

#The sleep/wake and autonomic functions are inspired by the analogous biological functions,
#but their purpose is not to mimic nature but provide a useful level of very high overall
#control of the MBLS with regard to the sleep/wake functions, and to provide
#"stimulus->action"=="reflex" == "reptilian-like neurological functioning" ie, no cortical-like
#functioning but more of stimulus-action functioning although the strong caveat is made
#here that reptiles and birds and have cortical-like portions of their pallium and the
#stimulus->action effect is actually much more involved and processed than say stimulus->action
#in a worm. Thus, really the autonomic functions should be thought of as providing
#invertebrate-like stimulus->action processing, or if the case of mammals is considered,
#basic reflexes and basic autonomic processing.
#
#
#This section will be divided in future as number of functions grow into separate sleep/wake
#section, separate reflex autonomic function section (useful for very fast decisions)
#and more processed autonomic function section.

    '''HLNs Autoconfigured as Pattern Memory1
    MBLS ARCHITECTURE VISIBLE COMPONENT
    Hopfield automatching will occur but just
    rough approximation rather than actual Hopfield-like network.
    #
    #
    The basic functional unit of the MBLS is not an artificial neuron but a reconfigurable unit containing a
Hopfield-like network (HLN) (Lyke, Christodoulou, et al., 2015, Rojas, 1996). While Hopfield networks
are typically thought of as requiring stationary inputs they can be extended for sequential learning
(Maurer, Hersch, and Billard, 2005). The HLN contains a Hopfield-like network as well as the circuitry
allowing it to rapidly reconfigure its connections with other HLNs. The weights of the connections
within the HLNs change gradually as in a conventional ANN. The weights of the connections between
different HLNs can be adjusted gradually with learning as in a conventional ANN, can be adjusted more
abruptly to form a more discrete logical relation between two HLNs, and as well can rapidly be configured
to maximal or minimal values to allow fast and extreme reconfiguration of the HLNs with each other.
This rapid reconfiguration of the HLNs can be done by the HLNs themselves â no external logic processing
unit is required. In rapid reconfigurations, there is an attempt by the HLNs to maximize meaningfulness,
where this is defined as the reciprocal of the Shannon entropy, as described below.
	#
	#
	A simplified view of one of the Hopfield-like networks (HLNs) is shown in Figure 2. An input vector goes
to the auto-associative processor, and its pattern may or may not be recognized here, depending on the values
of this auto-associative processorâs internal weights which have been shaped by learning experiences in
collaboration with the signal from the feedback vector.  To seed the hierarchical organization of HLNs in a
new MBLS, the default values of many of the auto-associative processors will be to produce a non-zero vector
to the vector processing unit for most non-zero input vectors.
The vector output of the auto-associative processor feeds into the vector processing unit, and depending on
this vectorâs values, a corresponding vector, which often may be of smaller size, then feeds into the
abstraction addressor. In response to the signal from the feedback vector, the abstraction addressor decides
which of many possible output vectors wired up as inputs to other HLNs will have non-zero outputs. The
abstraction addressor effectively allows a number of HLNs to rapidly reconfigure their connections to
each other.
	#
	#
	Another property of the MBLS that distinguishes it from other hierarchical pattern recognizer systems is
that via learning experiences and subsequent changes in weights, different HLNsâ outputs form stronger and
weaker connections with other HLNs, as occurs in other systems, but each HLN has multiple sets of outputs
wired/configured to different sets of HLNs. The entire MBLS can rapidly reconfigure itself to allow different
emergent output properties for a given set of inputs to the MBLS. A simple example of this is described
below and Sillustrated in Figure 3.
Applying statistical mechanics to neural networks, whether biological or artificial, is not new, indirectly
going back to SchrÃ¶dinger (Ramstead, Badcock, and Friston, 2018).  However, there is a wide variety of ways
these principles can be applied, including at different levels of organization of the system (Ackley,
Hinton, and Sejnowski, 1985; Clark, Watson and Friston, 2018). The MBLS uses the property of what is
defined here as âmeaningfulnessâ to guide its reconfigurations. Meaningfulness M is defined as the
reciprocal of the Shannon entropy (1,2):
H= -âiP(xi)log2P(xi)      (1)
M=1/H       (2)
As can be seen above, if we were flipping a coin, and it landed almost every time tails, for example,
then this sequence of almost all tails, would be considered a high amount meaningfulness M. In the MBLS,
if a particular sensory input caused a larger number of HLNs and at higher levels of the hierarchy of HLNs
for a particular sensory input to find a match in the auto-associative processors of their HLNs, than another
sensory input, then this particular sensory input would be said to have a higher meaningfulness M. For a given
sensory input, the HLNs can rapidly be reconfigured in different combinations with each other, to see what
configuration (i.e., connections between HLNs) can give a maximal meaningfulness. The implication of the
reconfiguration is not only to detect a signal in the sensory input, but to change the context or level of
abstraction in which the detected signal is considered for maximal meaningfulness, which then can affect
detection of subsequent signals in subsequent sensory inputs, since there may be a new configuration of
the HLNs. Conversely, the level of abstraction of the MBLS may be set a higher meta level from a vector
input fed back from a logic/working memory unit (which is essentially a âthoughtâ, as will be described
below), which will affect the detection of a particular signal in the subsequent sensory inputs.
	#
Figure 3 shows aspects of a simple simulation run. If the input vector [ ,  ,/, Â¬â,|,|, ] occurs
(not shown in the figure), which is an incomplete âAâ, then this would cause the auto-associative processor
of HLN(m-1,1) to recognize it as an âAâ and connect to HLN(m-3,2) which also recognizes the âAâ. Both
HLN(m-1,1) and HLN(m-3,2) match the input vector, and meaningfulness is easily maximized with this default
connection. (In the computer simulation the meaningfulness feedback vector is simply composed of the number
of HLNs which auto-associate, ie, match up, the input vector to the HLN. A myriad of more sophisticated
algorithms are possible, of course.)
	#
If the input vector [â, |, |,â, |, |, â,    ] occurs (not shown in figure), then this input can correspond,
at this low pixel input resolution, to a âBâ or to an â8â. However, the weights of the MBLS have been adjusted
by learning such that when this input vector goes into the MBLS, the auto-associative processor of HLN(m,1)
recognizes it as a âBâ and keeps the default connection to HLN(m-1,2) which also recognizes it as a âBâ, and the
feedback vector registers a high meaningfulness, and so the input vector [â, |, |,â, |, |, â,    ] is recognized
as a âBâ.
	#
If, as shown in Figure 3, there is then an input vector of [â, |, |,â, |, |, â,  |  ], since it is so close to the
previous example of the vector recognized as a âBâ, it will also be recognized by HLN(m,1) as a âBâ (or more correctly
as a vector which HLN(m,1) auto-associates and connects to the next HLN without really knowing what it is). Thus,
since HLN(m1,) is connected to HLN(m-1,2) which would recognize, ie, auto-associate the output from HLN(m,1), and thus
output a vector recognizing the input vector as a âBâ. However, other HLNs in the MBLS (not shown in the very simplified
Figure 3) would cause the feedback vector to report a much lower meaningfulness than if during the evaluation cycle, HLN(m,1)
connects to HLN(m,2). That is, if one of the possible reconfigurations of HLN(m,1) to HLN(m,2) occurs, there will be much
high meaningfulness (not shown, but because of other HLNs activating in the MBLS, eg, perhaps previously other HLNs activated
from this particular input vector or features within it) and thus the input vector causes HLN(m,2) be activated and cause the
input vector to be recognized as an â8â.

	The MBLS can be designed (via default weights) such that while some of the HLNs can auto-configure

other parts of the MBLS can auto-configure to set up a group(s) of HLNs which will act as a working

ranging from acting as small automatons to Church-Turing complete logical sub-systems). It is important

the connections an HLN has via connections to other HLNs. The working memory need not convert the
vectors from the HLN into some abstract symbolic data for the working memory to produce symbolic
behavior, i.e., manipulation of the HLN vectors it receives suffices. In the simulation of the MBLS,
described below, it can be shown that HLNs auto-configured as relatively simple logic/working memory
units are able to compare properties of vectors they receive, are able to choose one vector over
another, are able to pattern match a vector from the entire MBLS memory, and are able to direct the
MBLS to output a vector.
	#
As noted above, the MBLS can be designed so that there are group(s) of HLNs which will act as a working memory
with varying degrees of logical processing operating on the contents of this memory. These groups of HLNs,
âlogic/working memory unitsâ, are able to compare properties of vectors they receive, are able to choose one
vector over another, are able to pattern match a vector from the entire MBLS memory, and are able to direct the
MBLS to output a vector. A typical MBLS cognitive architecture is shown in Figure 4 below. Every evaluation cycle,
not only does the MBLS look at the meaningfulness of the data in the sensory input and cycle through varying levels
of abstraction so as to reconfigure the HLNs in a way to maximize local and system meaningfulness (via a feedback
vector to all the HLNs), but the sensory input vector or the casual memory vector it triggers (or other vectors,
as shown in the architecture of Figure 4) also go to the logic/working memory unit. The logic at the time may be
to do nothing, or it may be, for example to compare this vector with another vector previously triggered, and if
enough of a match then trigger another vector, for example, into the logic/working memory unit, or perhaps as an
output vector, for example.
Thus every evaluation cycle, the MBLS looks at the meaningfulness of the data in the sensory input vectors (local
and system meaningfulness is fed back to the HLNs via the feedback vector to allow evaluation of meaningfulness),
and the results of any operations in the logic/working memory, i.e., essentially a symbolic logical operation on the
data. The evaluation cycle completes, connections within the auto-associative processors of the HLNs are strengthened
or weakened in relation to neural-level activity and the feedback vector, connections between HLNs are strengthened and
weakened in response to the feedback vector, and the next evaluation cycle starts again. The above occurs automatically,
over and over again.
	#
In an evaluation cycle, rather than evaluating an input vector from the sensory systems, the MBLS can instead
equally evaluate a data vector from the logic/working memory unit as the next input vector. Essentially a thought
occurs. The current data vector from the logic/working memory is treated as the next input vector, and fed back into
the logic/working memory unit while HLNs are reconfigured to maximize meaningfulness. The evaluation cycle completes,
synapses are (or are set to be) strengthened or weakened, and the next evaluation cycle starts again. In the next evaluation
cycle the newly processed data vector in the logic/working memory can again be considered as the next input vector to evaluate.
As such, thoughts can be processed sequentially in a fashion to extract maximum meaningfulness from them.
	#

Creativity in solving problems is possible for the MBLS via algorithms applied to the logic/working memory units, and also
intrinsically within the HLNs. The operation of the MBLS can be skewed so that alternative solutions emerge that would not normally
represent the extraction of the maximal meaningfulness from the input (or thoughts from the working memory subunits), by altering
the values of the external inputs so as to give more obscure aspects of the input data closer pattern matching and hence a higher
value of meaningfulness.

    '''For use to compare the MBLS with other cognitive
    architectures and information systems.

    The MBLS architecture involves hierarchies of pattern recognizers
    (the HLNs) which gives it similarities but also different properties than deep learning
    systems (e.g., LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla et al., 2017; Goodfellow et al., 2016).  Work on hierarchies
    of pattern recognizers actually started many years ago with Mountcastleâs (1957) hypothesis
    concerning the columnar organization of the cerebral cortex, and continued strongly in the
    last two decades (e.g., George and Hawkins, 2009; LÃ¡zaro-Gredilla et al., 2017).
    The MBLS builds upon previous work in artificial neural networks and systems of
    hierarchies of pattern recognizers, but has a number of different learning mechanisms
    which can use common techniques from previous work (e.g., Hebbian-like learning and
    gradient descent-like algorithms within the HLNs and/or between the different HLNs)
    but also different ones too (e.g., discrete immediate strong connections between HLNs,
    only briefly touched upon above, e.g., extreme rapid reconfigurations of HLNs with each
    other depending on meaningfulness values). The MBLS has a number of different operational
    features than previous work, such as the extreme rapid reconfigurations it undergoes in
    an attempt to maximize meaningfulness. The MBLS has a number of different features in its
    architecture than previous work, such as for example, lack of sharp demarcation and structures
    for long-term procedural memory versus long-term declarative memory, but instead, it heavily
    relies on a long-term causal memory. As well, the MBLS incorporates from its elementary
    HLN units, without the aid of an external CPU or memory, regions that can symbolically process
    input vectors (as well as symbolically-processed data vectors fed back to itself as thoughts)
    in the context of the entire MBLS rather than independently as an external CPU would do.
    While recent works have started narrowing the neural-symbolic gap (e.g., Graves et al., 2016;
    Sabour et al., 2017), it is believed that the meaningful-based learning system (MBLS) can close
    it â the MBLS should be able to perform the sensory processing associated with artificial
    neural networks while retaining the efficiently learned causal symbolic processing of the
    human brain.

The goal of the MBLS-3.0 Implementation is to use the Meaningful-Based Cognitive Architecture
to control a Search-and-Rescue Robot, with the simulation of finding a lost hiker in a forest
filled with a host of sensory noise and other irrelevant sensory signals. Thus, the code above
must be able to somehow interface with the electronics of such a Search-and-Rescue Robot. This
issue has not been resolved at the time of this writing.

If a completely self-contained Search-and-Rescue Robot exists with some sort of interface to
high level instructions and data, then the issue becomes more of a digital communication issue
bidirectionally (the MBLS requires data in as well, not just instructions out) between the
MBLS code above and the Robot. More likely there will be the need to interface at a lower level
to the electronic circuitry of the Robot. In either case, there is the need of physical
communication between the above MBLS code and the Robot. 

At this time, the use of a MicroPython board (or multiple MicroPython boards) is considered as
the approach to the issue of communication, and would be able to handle a wide spectrum of
requirements from abstracted to detailed communication requirements between the main code and
the Robot hardware implementation.

MicroPython is an implementation of Python3 optimized to run on a compatible
micro-controller board. MicroPython is a subset of the full Python 3 and its Standard Library.
As such the above MBLS code has to be refactored so that necessary parts dealing with the
hardware implementation can run in the MicroPython environment. At the time of
this writing, MicroPython requires 256K of code space and 16K of RAM.

Note: MicroPython is an open source software under the MIT license which at this time has over
two hundred contributors.

Note: Although in theory MicroPython can run on a variety of micro-controller boards, in practice
a 'PyBoard' or equivalent (eg, WiPy IoT platform) should be used since the PyBoard has been
designed to run MicroPython code. PyBoards are not as readily available as other micro-controller
boards, eg, Arduino's, but can be commercially purchased from several sources at time of writing.

Note: MicroPython was not able to be run on an unmodified Arduino in MBLS proof of concept trials.
