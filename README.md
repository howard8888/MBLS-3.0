# MBLS-3.0
Version 3.0  Meaningful Based Learning System (MBLS)

The 'Meaningful Based Learning System' (MBLS) is an implementation of the Meaningful Based Cognitive Architecture.

version 1 - Winter 2017 - Initial transfer from whiteboards to Python simulation. No ANN libraries. Handcoded in Python 2.7.
Shannon diversity used to assess meaningfulness values.

version 2 - Spring 2018 - Switched to Python 3.6. Handcoded. No ANN libraries. Reciprocal of Shannon entropy now used to assess meaningulness. MBLS modules simulated by Python methods rather than simulating the collection of connected simulated HLNs. Causal memory now extensively used.

version 3 - Summer 2018 -work pending - Code refactored into a more professional appearance to allow future team working, eg, open source, on the code. Robert C. Martin's Clean Code software architecture and style being followed. HLNs being ramped up to 50,000 from a few dozen in previous versioons.
